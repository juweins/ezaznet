# ezaznet

ezaznet is a repository where I will store some scancrio configurations that I found useful to prepare for my AZ-700 exam. When you are preparing for the exam, you will find that there are a lot of things to remember. Thankfully Microsoft provides us with plenty of interactive learning material and even some guided labs. 

However, you may come to a point where you want to try it out yourself. Instead of manually clicking through the Azure portal, you can use the provided terraform configurations to set up your intended scenario and play around. Terraform gives you the ability to quickly set up and tear down your individual labs and hence saves you time and credits!



I hope this repository will help you to remember some of the things that you need to know for the exam. Feel free to use it as you like and please provide feedback if you find something that is not correct or could be improved. I will be happy to add it to the repository.
